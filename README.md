## Questions:
1) Manually run them locally before pushing code. Technically you understand your code best, so it's best to manually test your code before you push for reviewing by someone else. 
2) I would not use it for an individual function because I would rather use an unit test to test one function without checking the whole system. 
3) No, we need to see how the message feature of a messaging application interacts with the whole system, and how a user would typically interact with it. It would interact with users receiving messages, which is another feature.
4) Yes, we are debugging a singular part of the code that would not interact with another on a feature level.
